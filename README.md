This repository contains a Shiny application that uses the Messidor Features dataset to classify diabetic retinopathy using logistic regression. The app allows users to adjust the classification threshold and train/test split to see how these parameters affect accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the confusion matrix. It includes two files—app.R (the Shiny code) and messidor_features.arff (the dataset). The application can be run locally in RStudio or launched directly using shiny::runGitHub("messidor_shiny_logistic", "Roy1707018").
